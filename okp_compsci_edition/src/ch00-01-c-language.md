# The C Programming Language

While I search the Internet trying to find the right language to learn
first, I am confronted with a wall of so called, "dynamically typed"
languages. Such languages include: Python, Ruby, JavaScript (or ECMAScript)
etc. As I look at these languages I find myself seeing the same old thing -
an explanation of how to do something without really learning what goes
on behind the scenes, eg: "Here's how to make a blog" or "Here's how
to make a Todo Application". Great, but just typing in your code and 
running it doesn't mean I learned a damn thing. 

I find myself constantly looking for a language that will help me know
the innards of the computer, not the innards of a web browser. There
are some older languages I have looked at. One being the ultimate of
bare metal -> Assembly. However, as I read about it, I realized I still
want to keep my sanity so am now opting for a more portable language; one
where if I make a program on my primary system (GNU/Linux) I can compile it and
run it on another system (MacOS or Windows). 

I have decided to use, at least in the beginning, the C programming
language. Now, I have read many, many comments on the Internet stating
that C is a horrible choice as a first language. I disagree. I want to
learn how the computer really works and I want to manipulate it the way
I want. It is my understanding that C requires manual memory management.
This sounds like something I want. At least, like I stated before, for the 
beginning.

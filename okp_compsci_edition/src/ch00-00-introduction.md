## What is this?

This is my own personal experiment in trying to learn how to program.
I have set this up to document my progress over time and to improve
the material as I learn more and get better at the art of coding.
Over the years, I have regretted not actually taking the plunge into
programming. So, now I'm taking advantage of the current climate to
sink into the world of computer science and programming.

All are welcome to follow along, contribute and learn with me.

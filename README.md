# Sturgax's Open Knowledge Platform

In this repository I will store topics I am interesting in learning about
and document my progress here. While this is a personal effort, I do welcome
ideas and contributions.

All documented text will be done with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) which
is a nice little program for making technical books.

# Sturgax's Open Knowledge Platform - CompSci Edition

This repository is a place for documenting the progress I make while
learning how to program using the C programming language. It is completely
in the open and all are welcome to join me in learning how to program.

I plan on learning by tackling the absolute fundamentals of programming and
computers, eg.
* what is memory?

As I document my progress there will undeniably be mistakes and frustrations.
All of this is fine and expected. I have never really programmed anything
beyond a simple script here and there over the years. I have very, very
little experience with programming. I want to change that. If you're in the
same boat, join me. Make a lot of mistakes. Get frustrated and stuck. We'll
get it figured out.

## First Topics

Some of the first topics that I have been thinking about are:
* Binary
* RAM (memory)
* ROM (Read Only Memory)
